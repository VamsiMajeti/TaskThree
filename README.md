Random-Quotes-Project

A small project that changes the quote and author on the click of a button.

Working :

A set of quotes like to say 9 will already be typed with the authors name & the file will be saved the name can be given as you wish, Writing the coding part now generates the random quote,This can also be further extended as you wish.

As I'm somewhat familiar with Java I have did this mam I have leart it in previous semisters of my collage.
